The northern half of the continent is directed in an east-west direction, while the southern half has a more longitudinal orientation.\n",

    "Africa is separated from Europe by the Mediterranean Sea and from Asia by the Red Sea. Though its average elevation (approximately 600m asl) compares roughly to that of North and South America, Africa is unique in that it has a very small region of low and high elevation land. Areas of moderate elevation between 400 and 1200 meters make up the majority of the continent. Regions of elevation below 200 meters are in general confined to the immediate coastal region. The western edge of the southern continental half is extreme in this regard, with only a very narrow region of low elevation near the coast and an immediate increase in elevation to the southern plateau region (including the Great Karoo and the Kalahari Desert).\n",
    "\n",
    "Near the Mediterranean Sea at approximately 30°N, the Atlas Mountains span 2500km through Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, reaching a maximum height of 4167m at Jebel Toubkal. Moving southeast towards the center of the continent, one finds the Sahara Desert. The Sahara is the largest hot desert in the world (the third largest overall after Antarctica and the Arctic region). To the north it is bounded by the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlas Mountains, to the east by the Red Sea, to the west by the Atlantic Ocean and to the south by the Sahel, a semi-arid tropical savanna. The Nile, Africa's longest river, flows from south to north through the eastern part of the Sahara, enabling a narrow band of vegetation on either side.\n",
    "\n",
    "The plateau region of Africa, with elevations rarely below 600m can be divided into two subplateaus: the South African Plateau and the East African Plateau. The South African Plateau is bounded to the east, west and south by higher ground. To the north, the elevation drops as one approaches the Congo Basin. The South African Plateau is connected to the East African Plateau by a series of meridionally oriented features (tablelands, ridges, depressions, etc.) caused by tectonic activity. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Albertine Rift is the westernmost of these depressions and contains the lakes of Tanganyika, Kivu, Edward, and Albert. The eastern depression has much smaller lakes with the exception of Lake Turkana. These lakes are not visible in the topographic map above. The only easily visible lake is Lake Victoria which is located between the two previously mentioned lake belts in eastern Africa. The surface elevation of the lake is 1133m which is not captured in our data set (the data set has a surface elevation for Lake Victoria of 0m asl). \n",
    "\n",
    "A little further to the northeast, the Ethiopian Highlands can be found. This mountainous region contains the highest continuous area in Africa. Most of its area is above 1500m asl, and its highest peaks reach heights of around 4500m. Mt. Kilimanjaro (5895m), the highest mountain in Africa, is not located in the Ethiopian Highlands, but is rather an isolated volcano to the east of the eastern branch of the East African Rift Valley.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last major geographical feature of the African continent is the Congo Basin. The basin is located in the western half of Africa and near the Equator. The Congo River has a length of 4700km (9th longest), the second largest river discharge in the world, and it is also the world's deepest river (depths of up to 220m!). The basin has an area of 4 million square kilometers and covers approximately one eighth of the continent.\n"

As the ITCZ moves north, the Hadley cell also shifts to the north and thus, the regions of subsidence and higher temperatures also shift. As we would expect, the regions of maximal average temperature are quite similar in fall and spring when the maximum average solar elevation angle is located at the equator.\n",

By calculating the standard deviation of these 12 months we isolate the seasonal variability of the temperature from the interannual fluctuations caused by ENSO or other phenomena. \n",

    "As expected, the regions of lowest variation are located in the Congo Basin around the equator which is characterised year round by high convective clouds and the effect of the convergence zone. Although the exact location of the ITCZ shifts with the seasons, the convergence region is quite broad and the shift in location does not result in as much variation near the central oscillation location when compared to the regions nearer to the subsidence of the Hadley cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, there is low intra-annual variation along the west coast of the Sahara (which borders the Atlantic Ocean and has a more maritime climate). This difference in variation is due to the fact that water has a much higher heat capacity than air and so does not have as large a variation in temperature due to seasonal changes in radiative forcing. If we have a wind blowing over a large region of water, the air in the atmospheric boundary layer approaches that of the water. In the case of the Western Sahara, we typically have northern winds in that region of the Atlantic and a large region of ocean to the north. This results in the near-coast surface temperature variation of the atmosphere closely mirroring that of the ocean (naturally less than a more continental region). \n",
    "\n",
    "A careful observer may note that this decreased variability is not seen in the eastern Sahara at its border with the Red Sea. This could be due to two reasons. One the one hand, the average wind direction at 10 m is parallel to the Egyptian coast in the Red Sea and only turns inland as one reaches the Sudanese coastline. In this region, we do begin to observe a damped variability. The second reason for little decreased variability in temperature as one approaches the coastline of the eastern Sahara could be due to the relatively small surface area of the Red Sea (especially the small width in the direction perpendicular to the Egyptian coastline) and its isolation from large oceanic circulations. 'Below a depth of about 200-250 m the whole Red Sea basin with the exception of hot brine pools is filled with a remarkably constant temperature of about 21.5° C to 21.6° C.' : http://www.academia.edu/10358705/FORMATION_OF_A_SEASONAL_THERMOCLINE_IN_THE_RED_SEA The surface layer of the sea (especially the Northern Red Sea) has time to react to the strong seasonal forcing in radiation and its temperature adjusts. In contrast to the Atlantic Ocean, which in the region of the western African Coast contains currents transporting water from the North Atlantic southward, the Red Sea surface temperature is more closely correlated with the average surface temperature at its Coast. \n",
    "\n",
    "The highest variability in temperature occurs in the northern Sahara which, during the winter months, can be influenced by arctic air masses from nearby Europe, but experiences extremely warm summers. The further south one travels in the Sahara, the smaller the temperature variability. Analogously, in the southern Hadley cell, one sees a maximum temperature variability in the South African Plateau at a similar latitude deviation from the equator (approximately 30°)."

In the Congo Basin, the maximum monthly average temperature is on the order of 26°C. For comparison, the maximum monthly average temperature in Innsbruck is below 20°C.

The signal is much stronger during the summer than in winter. This is due to the large summer temperature maximum in the Sahara which covers almost the entire sector between 15°N and 30°N. The temperature minimum around 30°S during the northern summer is enhanced due to the high average elevation of the averaging region.

Between 15°E and 30°E the landmass distribution is strikingly symmetric about the equator.

    "This figure shows annual precipitation (given in mm/year). For reference, the average annual precipitation in Innsbruck is 900mm/year. Clearly visible are the large arid regions in the north (Sahara) and the south (Great Karoo, Kalahari Desert). It is interesting to note that Namibia (with an annual precipitaiton of mainly less than 400mm/year) consists of a coastal mountain range. It is quite unusual to see coastal ranges with little precipitation and this indicates that the mean flow in this region is not westerly or we would see more orographic precipitation. Further east, we see the precipitation increase towards the coast, which is indicative of an easterly average flow between 15°S and 30°S.\n",
    "\n",
    "The maximum average annual precipitation is found in the Congo Basin and the southern coastal regions of West Africa near the equator in the ITCZ. Further east, we see local precipitation maxima caused by orographic precipitation in the Ethiopian Highlands, for example. In contrast to the region further south, precipitation decreases as one travels east across the continent near the equator. At the horn of Africa, there is even a coastal desert. We can again deduce a mean atmospheric flow from these precipitation data, but in this latitudinal region, the flow is more westerly. Looking at average wind speed data in later figures, we will see that there is no strong average westerly flow in this region. In the Congo Basin, there is a weak average westerly flow, but further east to the south of the Horn of Africa, the flow is more southerly in nature. This results in a rain shadow effect in northern Somalia and little precipitation even at the coast."

This metric does not resolve any intra-annual variability. In other words, if a location has very distinct wet and dry seasons, this variability is not captured in the figure. We see a high yearly variability in regions with large average precipitations and especially in regions with large precipitation gradients. That is, we expect to see large interannual variability in regions where the average annual precipitation changes drastically over small spatial scales. Since the regions of precipitation within a certain year can be quite distinct, the exact location of the ITCZ can be the difference between a very wet and a very dry year in regions of high standard deviation of annual precipitation.

    "<font color='red'>Again: two figures now. </font> To get a better metric for the variability of the precipitation at a certain location, we correct the standard deviation of precipitation for the average annual precipitation by examining their quotient and calling it the coefficient of variation of precipitation. This metric has an advantage over the standard deviation in that it corrects for the expectedly larger annual variation of precipitation in regions with large precipitation (it can be seen as a type of percentual variability). The coefficient of variation is especially useful when researching the effect of atmospheric variability on the environment. In a region where it rarely ever rains, years with 100mm/year of rain represent a drastic change and can greatly affect human life. A 100mm/year precipitation change in the Congo Basin will go unnoticed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regions with a high coefficient of variation of precipitation include most regions of the Sahara between 15°N and 30°N and the coastal regions of Namibia and southern Angola. The variation in Namibia and Angola can be due to the large impact of shifting winds on orographic precipitation in the coastal mountain regions. If we have a shift from easterlies to westerlies, the precipitation amount will change from near zero to quite significant values, as the westerlies transport moist Atlantic air to the land, where the air is lifted, cools and condenses to form precipitation.

    "During the winter months there are divergent northeasterlies north of the equator which result in subsidence and suppressed rainfall. As the ITCZ is at its southernmost extent during this time of the year, the precipitation maxima are shifted south and the Angolan high plateau has a distinct wet season. The North African coast experiences rainfall due to increased frontal activity during this season and in fact every season apart from the summer (during which the region is dry). The precipitation in North Africa is mostly confined to the north of the Atlas Mountains in Morocco and Algeria.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the spring, the ITCZ moves north, and with it the precipitation maxima. We especially see an increase in precipitation in Eastern Africa between 0° and 15°N. This is the first of two distinct wet seasons in this area. The local maximum in the western Ethiopian Highlands due to orographic precipitation is again distinctly visible.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the northern summer, the ITCZ has reached its northernmost extent. Although the surface pressure signal of the ITCZ has an amplitude of approximately 20°, the fluctuation in the precipitation signal to the north of the equator is clearly damped. There is never a large seasonal average precipitation north of 15°N in the Sahara. During the winter, the precipitation begins south of approximately 5°N. So, the amplitude of the fluctuation in the northern half is approximately 10°. Compare this to the surface pressure fluctuation amplitude of approximately 20° and the earth orbital axis tilt of 23.5°. In the southern half of Africa, the seasonal precipitation fluctuations more closely resemble the pressure fluctuations. This is due to the aforementioned orientation of the main continental axes. The southern half of Africa is exclusively east of 15°E and is connected to the northern half with no oceanic interruptions. The latitudinal range of land east of 15°E is from 30°N to 35°S (75°). In contrast, west of 15°E, we have ocean south of 5°N and a continental meridional extent of 5°N to 35°N (approximately half of that of the eastern continental region). This explains the increased oscillation of the ITCZ in the south of Africa. It is due to the fact that the southern half of Africa is exclusively in the more continental eastern half.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the fall months, the precipitation distribution is quite similar to that of the spring, with the second seasonal maximum visible in eastern Africa.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the location of the ITCZ fluctuates over a larger meridional range in the east of Africa when compared to west, the annual precipitation is spread over a larger region and we naturally see smaller values of annual precipitation for given locations in the east. If we were to sum the precipitation meridionally (arriving at a plot of annual precipitation vs longitude) there would not be such a large apparent precipitation maximum in the African west. "

The band of strongest intra-annual variability is narrower in the northern hemisphere than in the southern hemisphere since the slope of the boundary separating strong and weak precipitation is shallower. In other words, the boundary between strong and weak precipitation moves further (in ° latitude) per month in the southern hemisphere than in the northern hemisphere.\n",
