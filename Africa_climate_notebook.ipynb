    "A topographic map of the African continent can be seen above. It is immediately obvious that the continent is structurally divided into two parts based on latitude. The northern half of the continent is directed in an east-west direction, while the southern half has a more meridional orientation.\n",

    "Africa is separated from Europe by the Mediterranean Sea and from Asia by the Red Sea. Though its average elevation (approximately 600m asl) compares roughly to that of North and South America, Africa is unique in that it has a very small region of low and high elevation land. Areas of moderate elevation between 400 and 1200 meters make up the majority of the continent. Regions of elevation below 200 meters are in general confined to the immediate coastal region. The western edge of the southern continental half is extreme in this regard, with only a very narrow region of low elevation near the coast and an immediate increase in elevation to the southern plateau region (including the Great Karoo and the Kalahari Desert).\n",
    "\n",
    "Near the Mediterranean Sea at approximately 30°N, the Atlas Mountains span 2500km through Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, reaching a maximum height of 4167m at Jebel Toubkal. Moving southeast towards the center of the continent, one finds the Sahara Desert. The Sahara is the largest hot desert in the world (the third largest overall after Antarctica and the Arctic region). To the north it is bounded by the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlas Mountains, to the east by the Red Sea, to the west by the Atlantic Ocean and to the south by the Sahel, a semi-arid tropical savanna. The Nile, Africa's longest river, flows from south to north through the eastern part of the Sahara, supplying moisture to a narrow band of vegetation on either side.\n",
    "\n",
    "The plateau region of Africa, with elevations rarely below 600m can be divided into two subplateaus: the South African Plateau and the East African Plateau. The South African Plateau is bounded to the east, west and south by higher ground. To the north, the elevation drops as one approaches the Congo Basin. The South African Plateau is connected to the East African Plateau by a series of meridionally oriented features (tablelands, ridges, depressions, etc.) caused by tectonic activity. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Albertine Rift is the westernmost of these depressions and contains the lakes of Tanganyika, Kivu, Edward, and Albert. The eastern depression has much smaller lakes with the exception of Lake Turkana. These lakes are not visible in the topographic map above. The only easily visible lake is Lake Victoria which is located between the two previously mentioned lake belts in eastern Africa. The surface elevation of the lake is 1133m which is not captured in our data set (the data set has a surface elevation for Lake Victoria of 0m asl as it is included in the ocean map).  \n",
    "\n",
    "A little further to the northeast, the Ethiopian Highlands can be found. This mountainous region contains the highest continuous area in Africa. Most of its area is above 1500m asl, and its highest peaks reach heights of around 4500m. Mt. Kilimanjaro (5895m), the highest mountain in Africa, is not located in the Ethiopian Highlands, but is rather an isolated volcano to the east of the eastern branch of the East African Rift Valley.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last major geographical feature of the African continent is the Congo Basin. The basin is located in the western half of Africa and near the Equator. The Congo River has a length of 4700km (9th longest), the second largest river discharge in the world, and it is also the world's deepest river (depths of up to 220m!). The basin has an area of 4 million square kilometers and covers approximately one eighth of the continent.\n",

It is important to note that the meteorological seasons differ from the calendar seasons by approximately three weeks. December 1 is the start of the meteorological winter compared to December 21/22 for the calendar winter. The meteorologically defined seasons are more appropriate to use when explaining the effect of sun angle on climate since the equinoxes and solstices are located within the seasons rather than at the start and end of them as in the calendar seasons. The northern calendar winter starts on the day that the sun angle is lowest in the northern hemisphere, while effects of the low sun angle are seen more in early December than in early March. In Africa, as in most regions of the world, the region with the highest average temperature shifts with the seasons. \n",

    "In the winter, the highest temperatures are located between 0° and 15°N and between 30°S and 15°S. In the summer, this region moves northward to between 15°N and 30°N. This shift is caused by the seasonal variation in the intertropical convergence zone due to solar elevation angle changes caused by the earth's axis tilt with respect to its solar orbit. As the ITCZ moves north, the Hadley cell also shifts to the north and thus, the regions of subsidence and higher temperatures also shift. As we would expect, the regions of maximal average temperature are quite similar in fall and spring when the maximum average solar elevation angle is located at the equator.\n",

    "Above we see two plots of interannual variation of surface temperature defined in different manners. In the first figure, the interannual standard deviation is calculated for each month and these 12 values are averaged. In the second, the standard deviation of the yearly averages is shown. Depending on what phenomena we wish to observe, we will examine different plots. \n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the difference we consider a thought experiment. Imagine a location with strong intra-annual variability and sharply defined seasons. Typically July and August are by far the hottest months. If the arrival of the hot season changes such that June and July are now the hottest, but the average yearly temperature is unchanged, the first figure will show a nonzero interannual variation, while the second (with a calculation of standard deviation based on yearly averages) is 0. The ratio between the two figures would then be a measure of the interannual variation in the seasonality and comparing this with the standard deviation of the intra-annual variation over all years of the dataset, we could even begin to understand how the effects of changing seasonal 'amplitude' (how much the relative magnitude of hot and cold months change) and seasonal 'timing' (how the months in which the hottest and coldest months occur change) factor into the total interannual variation and which factor is dominant. As a mathematical side note, our first calculation of interannual variation is always greater than the second calculation (averaging over the year first) for any specific location.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both figures the interannual variability in temperature is low in the tropics where we know there is also low intra-annual variability. The Sahel Zone (especially southern Chad) has the highest variability in yearly average temperatures and this with a nearly equal variability calculated by the first method. The ratio of the two method results can be seen in the figure below and is quite low for southern Chad (1.2-1.6) when compared to other regions with high interannual variability. From this we can infer that the phase and amplitude of seasonal temperature fluctuations did not change that much from year to year in Chad and large regions of the eastern Sahel Zone. Most of the interannual variability was simply due to a shift in the average temperature. The arrival time and strength of warm and cold periods is constant from year to year. So by knowing the average temperature of a certain year in the eastern Sahel Zone, we can not deduce much information about the intra-annual variability compared to another year with different average temperature. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is also the case in most of the tropics, where the ratio calculated below is between 1.2 and 1.6. In general, the further one is away from the tropics, the greater the ratio of calculations one and two and therefore the greater the inter-annual variability of intra-annual variability (plus inter-annual variability in timing) of surface temperature. The maximum values are found in Morocco, where the average temperature does not change much interannually, but specific monthly averages can be much different from year to year. This makes planning a vacation to central Morocco quite difficult!\n"

Doing this, we got an average monthly surface temperature for each of the 12 months. By calculating the standard deviation of these 12 months, we isolate the seasonal variability of the temperature from the interannual fluctuations caused by ENSO or other phenomena. \n",
    "\n",
    "As expected, the regions of lowest variation are located in the Congo Basin around the equator which is characterised year round by high convective clouds and the effect of the convergence zone. Although the exact location of the ITCZ shifts with the seasons, the convergence region is quite broad and the shift in location does not result in as much variation near the central oscillation location when compared to the regions nearer to the subsidence of the Hadley cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, there is low intra-annual variation along the west coast of the Sahara (which borders the Atlantic Ocean and has a more maritime climate). This difference in variation is due to the fact that water has a much higher heat capacity than air and so does not have as large a variation in temperature due to seasonal changes in radiative forcing. If we have a wind blowing over a large region of water, the air in the atmospheric boundary layer approaches that of the water. In the case of the Western Sahara, we typically have northern winds in that region of the Atlantic and a large region of ocean to the north. This results in the near-coast surface temperature variation of the atmosphere closely mirroring that of the ocean (naturally less than a more continental region). \n",
    "\n",
    "A careful observer may note that this decreased variability is not seen in the eastern Sahara at its border with the Red Sea. This could be due to two reasons. One the one hand, the average wind direction at 10 m is parallel to the Egyptian coast in the Red Sea and only turns inland as one reaches the Sudanese coastline. In this region, we do begin to observe a damped variability. The second reason for little decreased variability in temperature as one approaches the coastline of the eastern Sahara could be due to the relatively small surface area of the Red Sea (especially the small width in the direction perpendicular to the Egyptian coastline) and its isolation from large oceanic circulations. 'Below a depth of about 200-250 m the whole Red Sea basin with the exception of hot brine pools is filled with a remarkably constant temperature of about 21.5° C to 21.6° C.' (Al-Barakati, 2009): The surface layer of the sea (especially the Northern Red Sea) has time to react to the strong seasonal forcing in radiation and its temperature adjusts. In contrast to the Atlantic Ocean, which in the region of the western African Coast contains currents transporting water from the North Atlantic southward, the Red Sea surface temperature is more closely correlated with the average surface temperature at its Coast. \n",
    "\n",
    "The highest variability in temperature occurs in the northern Sahara which, during the winter months, can be influenced by arctic air masses from nearby Europe, but experiences extremely warm summers. The further south one travels in the Sahara, the smaller the temperature variability. Analogously, in the southern Hadley cell, one sees a maximum temperature variability in the South African Plateau at a similar latitude deviation from the equator (approximately 30°)."

The highest monthly surface temperature in our dataset is in the northwestern Sahara, in central Algeria. The lowest monthly temperatures on record, apart from the high elevation regions, are located in the Congo basin. At first glance this would be surprising since this region is located near the Equator, but the color scale overemphasizes the magnitude of the cold. In the Congo Basin, the maximum monthly average temperature is on the order of 26°C. For comparison, the maximum monthly average temperature in Innsbruck is below 20°C. Such a low temperature is found in Africa only at very high elevations in the Southern Plateau and the Ethiopian highlands. As we see, Africa is a very warm continent."

The coefficient of variation is especially useful when researching the effect of atmospheric variability on the environment.

If we have a shift from easterlies to westerlies, the precipitation amount will change from near zero to quite significant values, as the westerlies transport moist Atlantic air to the land, where the air is lifted, cools and condenses to form precipitation.

Although the surface pressure signal of the ITCZ has an amplitude of approximately 20°, the fluctuation in the precipitation signal to the north of the equator is clearly damped.

So, the amplitude of the fluctuation in the northern half is approximately 10°. Compare this to the surface pressure fluctuation amplitude of approximately 20° and the earth orbital axis tilt of 23.5°. In the southern half of Africa, the seasonal precipitation fluctuations more closely resemble the pressure fluctuations. This is due to the aforementioned orientation of the main continental axes. The southern half of Africa is exclusively east of 15°E and is connected to the northern half with no oceanic interruptions. The latitudinal range of land east of 15°E is from 30°N to 35°S (75°). In contrast, west of 15°E, we have ocean south of 5°N and a continental meridional extent of 5°N to 35°N (approximately half of that of the eastern continental region). This explains the increased oscillation of the ITCZ in the south of Africa. It is due to the fact that the southern half of Africa is exclusively in the more continental eastern half.\n",

    "During the northern summer, the pressure minimum is located in the Sahara between 15° and 30°N and corresponds to the low level convergence of the Hadley Cell. In fall and winter, this low pressure region shifts southward, especially over the eastern half of the continent. This pattern has been discussed extensively in the precipitation section above. More interesting are the changing wind patterns with season. The winds associated with the high pressure gyres over the oceans are relatively constant. In West Africa (from south-west in summer to north-east in winter) and also in the Horn of Africa we see that the wind direction changes by more than 120°. Over East Africa, this effect is directly related to the Indian Monsoon and we see a northeasterly wind in the winter which is also the Indian dry season. During the summer months, the \"meridionally oriented East African Highlands act as a mechanical barrier to the South Indian Ocean south-east trades and concentrate the low-level flow intercepting the barrier crossing the Equator as an intense low-level flow called the Somalia Jet\" (Webster and Fasullo 2003). \n",

    "At the 900hPa level, we see regions of higher geopotential height at around 30° north and south of the Equator. These are the regions where we have subsidence from the Hadley Cell. As one nears the Equator, the geopotential height decreases and this is understandable as we have a region of low level convergence and rising air associated with the ITCZ. This signal of high and low geopotential heights at 900hPa due to the Hadley Cell is naturally clearer in the western part of the continent as the ITCZ is more stationary there and we are looking at the yearly average.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now at the 200hPa level, which is typically located at the top of the troposphere, we would expect an opposite signal. Above regions of tropospheric rising air (the ITCZ) we have a local maximum in pressure immediately below the more stably stratified stratosphere. (If we look at a region of constant height and find a pressure maximum it corresponds to a geopotential height maximum at that pressure level.) Similarly, regions of subsidence and low level horizontal divergence have horizontal convergence and lower geopotential heights above them at 200hPa. These regions are found just to the north and to the south of the African continental extremes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strongest winds are found (by the geostrophic wind relation) and assuming constant Coriolis parameter (and thereby latitude) where the gradients in the geopotential heights are strongest. This occurs near 30°N and 30°S at the 200hPa level and the geopotential heights at this pressure surface are much less influenced by the topography of the ground and the relative location of oceans. At the 900hPa level we see at 30°S two very strong geopotential height maxima at 30°S: one in the Atlantic and the other in the Indian Ocean. Another height maximum is found in the North Atlantic to the west of the Iberian Peninsula. These permanent surface wind structures drive ocean currents and their locations correspond to three of the five major ocean gyres (North Atlantic, South Atlantic, and Indian Ocean Gyres). Ocean gyres circulate clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and counterclockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. They are the reason that the western coasts of continents typically have cooler sea temperatures than the eastern coasts.\n",
    "\n",
    "At 700hPa (approximately 3km asl), the Easterly African Jet is very visible over western Africa between 0° and 15°N. Large temperature and moisture gradients between the Sahara Desert and the much cooler Gulf of Guinea result in vertical wind shear as explained by the thermal wind relationship (Cook 1999). In the Northern Hemisphere, the geostrophic wind increases with height in the direction where warmer temperatures are to the right and colder temperatures to the left. In the absence of a temperature gradient at a certain height level, there is no vertical wind shear. This means that the maximum geostrophic wind has been reached at the level where the horizontal temperature gradient vanishes. In the case of the Easterly African Jet, this happens at a height of approximately 3km, which is why we chose to examine the 700hPa level in addition to 900hPa and 200hPa. We would expect the temperature gradient between the Sahara and the ocean to the south to be largest near the surface and the vertical wind shear to be strongest at lower levels. Between 700hPa and 200hPa we must have, on average, an opposite horizontal temperature gradient (colder air over the Sahara) since the geostrophic wind decreases with height until it is essentially nonexistant at 200hPa. The latitudinal location of the upper level jet changes very strongly with the seasons and so averages to about 0 between 10°S and 10°N. In the cross-section below, we even see an easterly wind of greater than 15m/s at 200hPa in August. In the yearly average, we see no significant easterlies anywhere over Africa!\n",
    "\n",
    "The exact location and strength of the Easterly African Jet changes over the course of the year, reaching its northernmost extent (16-17°N) in August and its maximum wind speed (50km/h) at a slightly lower latitude in September (Cook 1999). The thermal wind relation and the geostrophic wind balance both rely on the presence of a coriolis force. For a given gradient in temperature or geopotential, we would expect a larger thermal or geostrophic wind, respectively, further from the Equator. To verify this information with our dataset, we would need to replot the above figures for specific months instead of just the annual average. Changes in the Easterly African Jet due to desertification of the Sahel Region and subsequent variations in ground heating and temperature gradients are of some interest to climate researchers since the jet is responsible for cyclone formation and Hurricane activity in the Gulf of Mexico and along the eastern United States (Donnelly and Jonathan, 2007)."

    "Even though the African continent is free of large topographic barriers, has a simple L-shape and relatively constant annual solar insolation at the top of the atmosphere, understanding its climate is no easy feat. In this report, we wanted to strike a balance between (1) reducing our analysis to several driving factors in order to understand the way they combine to influence the African climate and (2) taking such a simplistic approach that we arrive at false conclusions about their true dynamical connections. \n",
    "\n",
    "After all, Africa is just a part of the larger Earth and attempting to understand its climate, as we largely did, by focusing on data confined to the continent, is difficult to do without oversimplifying things. If there was a phenomenon we could not explain with some confidence, we did not attempt to find a less convincing line of reasoning which supports its existence but did not convince us.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many things that can be understood about climate variability by combining different statistical analyses of the weather, but we must remember that there are several limitations placed on us by the data we have. For one, it has already been monthly averaged to save space. This does not allow us to resolve any intra-annual variability on scales of less than one month. Additionally, the data has only a limited spatial resolution of (0.75° squared) and the values are not obtained from true observations, but an interpolation of observations with model runs. Due to this complicated data assimiliation process, we can not make any statements about the reliability of the data or our subsequent analyses. Any conclusions made in this project should therefore be taken with a grain of salt."
